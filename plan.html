<h2>Name:</h2>
<p>Micheal Brady-Mahoney</p>
<h2>Goals:</h2>

<!--We are a small local company, hoping to improve our business by getting on the net. We get about 100 people playing
at Slammers each week. The web site should produce an increase of customers of at least 50%. Volleyball is a great
family sport, so we think more young families would enjoy being part of what we offer – volleyball (including professional
competitions sometimes), socialising, licensed bar (happy hour every day from 6-7pm), available to hire for functions
– fun and fitness.-->

<!--We get players of all ages, but mostly they are 35 – 50. We want the site to appeal to a younger audience, getting
kids playing while they’re in high school (15 – 30). We think more people would play and come and watch competitions if
they knew about us more.-->

<p>Goal of the website is to increase number of customers playing volleyball at slammers by at least 50%.</p>
<p>The website is needed as they currently do not have an online presence and are missing out on a plethora of advertising avenues such as <br>
    Google ads, Facebook, and general search-engine searches</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation:</h2>
<p>Success of the website can be measured in multiple ways from number of responses to team sign-up form, <br>
    Google Analytics from search-engine and Google ads clicks, to measuring the number of people playing Volleyball and profits</p>

<h2>Target Audience:</h2>
<p>Majority of people who would click on this website would mainly be tech-savvy user either interested in playing <br>
    volleyball or looking to try a new sport or hobby.</p>
<p>They would be both male and female, either high-school aged kids (13 - 17yo) wanting to join a team and partake in an after-school activity, <br>
    they could also be people who have finished school recently and are looking to take up a sport to meet new people, <br>
    or they could be families looking for a weekend activity to do with kids.</p>
<p>These three groups of people would all be well used to the internet so the page would not have to be computer-illiterate friendly <br>
as it would for the older users.</p>
